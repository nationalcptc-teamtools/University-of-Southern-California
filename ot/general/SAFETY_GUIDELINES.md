# OT Cybersecurity Automation Scripts - Safety Guidelines

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THESE SCRIPTS ARE DESIGNED FOR OT ENVIRONMENTS AND MUST BE USED WITH EXTREME CAUTION**

Operational Technology (OT) environments control critical infrastructure including:
- Power generation and distribution
- Water treatment and distribution
- Manufacturing processes
- Transportation systems
- Oil and gas operations
- Chemical processing

**ANY DISRUPTION TO THESE SYSTEMS CAN RESULT IN:**
- Safety hazards to personnel
- Environmental damage
- Economic losses
- Regulatory violations
- Public safety risks

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY PRINCIPLES

### 1. SAFETY FIRST
- **NEVER** run these scripts on production OT systems without proper authorization
- **ALWAYS** test in isolated environments first
- **ALWAYS** have a rollback plan
- **ALWAYS** coordinate with operations teams

### 2. MINIMAL IMPACT DESIGN
- All scripts use conservative timeouts and delays
- Passive monitoring where possible
- Non-intrusive scanning techniques
- Graceful error handling

### 3. OT-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS
- Respect OT protocols and timing requirements
- Avoid disrupting real-time communications
- Consider system availability windows
- Understand process dependencies

## üìã PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Running Any Script:

- [ ] **Authorization**: Verify you have written authorization from plant management
- [ ] **Safety Review**: Complete safety review with operations team
- [ ] **Backup**: Ensure system backups are current
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Have a clear rollback procedure
- [ ] **Communication**: Notify all relevant stakeholders
- [ ] **Testing**: Test in isolated environment first
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Have monitoring systems in place
- [ ] **Emergency Contacts**: Have emergency contacts ready

### Environment Assessment:

- [ ] **System Criticality**: Understand the criticality of target systems
- [ ] **Process State**: Verify processes are in safe state
- [ ] **Network Topology**: Map network connections and dependencies
- [ ] **Protocol Requirements**: Understand OT protocol timing requirements
- [ ] **Safety Systems**: Verify safety systems are operational
